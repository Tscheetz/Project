# python 3.6 (32-bit) is used 
# all images must be downloaded and be put into a folder titled 'assets'
# the game is Flappy Bird, the template was found on Github and the author is cited in the code which can be found under 'MAIN_CODE.PY'  
#/the big aspect of the game is the different themes     
#/the themes are taken from User imput where the user is able to choose from (beach, space, original, mario or pro)   
#/the magic of the themes comes from the different images    
#/there is no main menu (it was attempted but unsuccessful)    
#/there is a score to see what level you are on     
#/music/sound effects were also unsuccessful but the files for the sounds are available to be downloaded     
#/'pro' theme speeds up the game, decreases the gap between obstacles and has the user falling faster making for a more difficult experience   
#/this code was created for the Intro to Computer Programing class at Bellarmine in 2018     
#/enjoy the game
